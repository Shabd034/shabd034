# üëã Hi, I'm Shabd Gupta  

I'm a **Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo** with experience in **embedded systems, manufacturing, hardware-software integration, computer vision, and graphics**.  
I‚Äôve worked at **Formlabs, Lumentum, and Ford** on projects ranging from **3D printer calibration and high-speed LiDAR development to manufacturing automation and process optimization/control**.  
Passionate about building **reliable, high-performance systems** at the intersection of **hardware and software**, I enjoy tackling problems that combine **low-level programming, real-time systems, system software and GPU programming**.
